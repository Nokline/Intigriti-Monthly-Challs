## Introduction
This month's Intigriti XSS challenge was quite a suprise. At first, I approached it thinking it was going to be a single step XSS filter bypass, but I was very wrong...
The challenge was a simple PHP website which displayed blog posts from the given value in the month parameter. Despite what you might expect for an XSS challenge, the month parameter was not actually vulnerable to an XSS, but was vulnerable to an SQL injection...
If your first instinct was to run SQLmap like me, well, you would have gotten rickrolled like the rest of us. So, how do we turn an SQLi to an XSS?
If you want to try it out on your own, or follow my steps while reading the writeup, try the challenge here: https://challenge-0722.intigriti.io/challenge/challenge.php

## TL;DR
Double SQLi to angular CSP bypass via browser focus stealing or JSONP

## Step by Step

#### To get a reflected input onto the page:
- As we can see, each page is reflected with the date, author, title and content of the post, corresponding to it's month value<img src=/Screen%20Shot%202022-07-29%20at%209.26.57%20AM.png width=60% height=60% />
- We've already said that the month value was not reflected onto the page, and instead we have a pretty simple SQL injection
- If you want to run SQLmap on it, go right ahead, but spoiler alert, it will only lead you to a rickroll
- Since there was nothing interesting in the database, other than a rickroll of course, we can unionize the columns of the original SQL query with our own values which will be reflected in the page.
- To do this, we will use the SQL injection in the month parameter (quotes seemed to have been filtered, so we will use the hex values for `<>` instead of strings because MySQL will convert it to strings automatically): `3 UNION SELECT 0x3c3e,0x3c3e,0x3C3e,0x3C3e,0x3C3e`
- When we send this payload, we see that the values we passed in the columns are reflected in the response, but they are HTML encoded </br><img src=/Screen%20Shot%202022-07-29%20at%209.35.57%20AM.png height=50% width=50%/>
- so at first glance it seems like an XSS might not be possible after all... until we realize that one column was not reflected, the author column

#### To bypass the HTML encoding: 
- We need to try to reflect the value of the author column onto the page to check if it is passed through HTML encoding
- If we pass `1` to the author column, we can see that an author name will be reflected onto the page
- We can assume that the author column actually takes the ID of the author, and the result will be passed into another SQL query which will get the author name by the ID
-  So, if the first SQL query was vulnerable to SQL injection, it is a safe assumption to make that the second "inner" SQL query is vulnerable to SQLi too.
-  Since the author column also takes  so we will do a similar union SQL injection, and this time we will try to use `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>` encoded in hex: `3 UNION SELECT NULL,0x3c7363726970743e616c65727428646f63756d656e742e646f6d61696e293c2f7363726970743e,NULL`

#### Now put together both SQLi payloads to reflect the XSS onto the page
- Encode the second SQL injection in hex and put it into the fourth column of the union of the first SQL injection: `3 UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,0x3320554e494f4e2053454c454354204e554c4c2c30783363373336333732363937303734336536313663363537323734323836343666363337353664363536653734326536343666366436313639366532393363326637333633373236393730373433652c4e554c4c,NULL`
- "That was a nice challenge, not too hard" I thought to myself when I saw the payload reflected in my burpsuite repeater, all I needed now was to copy the URL and open it in the browser to see the alert. <img src="/Screen%20Shot%202022-07-29%20at%209.50.09%20AM.png" height=50% width=50%/>
- However, when I tried it, nothing happened... There was still a CSP we needed to bypass 

#### What is CSP?
- I wont go into too much detail on what CSP is because there is a great documentation over at [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
- but simply put, CSP stands for Content-Security-Policy, and it sets rules for how and from where third part resources can be loaded. 
- The configuration for CSP can be found in the `Content-Security-Policy` response header. 
- In our case, the configuration was `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' *.googleapis.com *.gstatic.com *.cloudflare.com`
- This means that we cannot execute inline scripts (embedded javascript) such as `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`, we can only load scripts from the whitelisted domains
- There are many different CSP bypasses for different configurations, but this one specifically was pretty strict. We were only able to find 2 bypasses which worked on page load for both Firefox and Chrome

#### To bypass CSP (Focus Stealing):
- As we can see, \*.cloudflare.com is a whitelisted CSP domain, which means that we can include scripts from it. Cloudflare hosts angular, which is known to bypass CSP
- Unfortunately, none of the angular payloads we tried worked onload for Firefox. The closest I got to was onload for chrome by autofocusing an input and using angular's ng-focus, which will execute javascript as soon as the input element is on focus: `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.4.5/angular.min.js"></script>
<input autofocus ng-app ng-csp ng-focus="$event.composedPath()|orderBy:'[].constructor.from([document.domain],alert)'">` which we got from https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet#angularjs-csp-bypasses
- This didn't work on page load for firefox however, because firefox autofocuses the element before interpreting any javascript, so ng-focus will not see the action change from blur to autofocus unless the user actually clicked on the input box, which is a pretty lame XSS. We can do better than that
- To bypass this, we used a little trick called focus-stealing. Focus stealing is pretty much what it sounds like, it's a way to steal the focus from a program, or in out case, an HTML input element. It's as if you are distracting the attention of the browser, which is perfect for this scenario.
- Usually, focus-stealing will be used to redirect/steal the user-input between a user and a trusted input-object, however we will be using it a little differently
- So to get an onload XSS on firefox, we changed the angular action from ng-focus to ng-blur. Now, the input element will render autofocused, and whenever a user clicks out of it, it will trigger the ng-blur action and the XSS will execute on page load. 
- Now, all we have to do is find a way to automatically steal the focus (distract the browser) from the autofocused input element to trigger the XSS
- To do this, we included a meta tag in our payload which will redirect the user to mail someone. But why?
- On a normal redirection, the entire page will just be redirected and the XSS won't have time to execute. However, when redirecting a user to mail someone, they will not actually be redirected to a different page, but instead a new popup will appear asking them which mail client they want to use
- This popup effectively steals the focus from the input element, causing a blur, which triggers angular's ng-blur, and thus executes the XSS
- The final XSS payload looked like: ``<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.4.5/angular.min.js"></script><input ng-app ng-csp ng-blur="$event.composedPath()|orderBy:'[].constructor.from([document.domain],alert)'" autofocus id="test">
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1;URL=mailto:someone@example.com">``
- And when wrapped in the Double SQLi, it looks like [this](#final-payload-focus-stealing)

#### To bypass CSP (JSONP):
- After bypassing the CSP with focus stealing, we became aware of a much simpler solution.
- We were aware of the JSONP attack vector beforehand, however couldn't find a good one in any of the whitelisted domains despite the amount of googling and waybackurls we did
- Interestingly enough, this simple JSONP endpoint seemed to work too: [`https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?callback=alert(document.domain)`](https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?callback=alert(document.domain)//), I still find it pretty weird how google allows this lol <img src="/Screen%20Shot%202022-07-29%20at%209.57.25%20AM.png" width=50% height=50% />
- This leads us to the following XSS payload `<script src='https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?callback=alert(document.domain);'></script>`
- And wrapped in the [Double SQLi injection](#final-payload-jsonp)
