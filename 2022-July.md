## Introduction
This month's Intigriti XSS challenge was quite a suprise. At first, I approached it thinking it was going to be a single step XSS filter bypass, but I was very wrong...
The challenge was a simple PHP website which displayed blog posts from the given value in the month parameter. Despite what you might expect for an XSS challenge, the month parameter was not actually vulnerable to an XSS, but was vulnerable to an SQL injection...
If your first instinct was to run SQLmap like me, well, you would have gotten rickrolled like the rest of us. So, how do we turn an SQLi to an XSS?

## TL;DR
Double SQLi to angular CSP bypass via browser focus stealing or JSONP

## Step by Step

#### To get a reflected input onto the page:
- Union SQL injection in the month parameter (quotes are not available so we will use hex instead): `3 UNION SELECT payloadhere`

#### To bypass the HTML encoding: 
- We need to try the author column which is not reflected in the page, but is passed to another unsafe SQL query, so we will do another SQL injection: `payload`

#### Now put together both SQLi payloads to reflect the XSS onto the page
- Encode the second SQL injection in hex and put it into the fourth column of the union of the first SQL injection: ``

#### To bypass CSP (Focus Stealing):
- As we can see, *.cloudflare.com is a whitelisted CSP domain, which means that we can include scripts from it. Cloudflare hosts angular, which is known to bypass CSP
- Unfortunately, none of the angular payloads I tried worked onload for firefox. The closest I got to was onload for chrome by autofocusing an input and using angular's ng-focus, which will execute javascript as soon as the element is on focus: `` 
- This didn't work for firefox however, because firefox autofocuses the element before interpreting any javascript, so ng-focus will not see the action change from blur to autofocus
- To bypass this, we used a little trick called focus-stealing. Focus stealing is pretty much what it sounds like, it's a way to steal the focus from a program, or in out case, an html input element. It's as if you are distracting the attention of the browser
- Usually, focus-stealing will be used to redirect/steal the user-input between a user and a trusted input-object, however we will be using it a little differently
- So to get an onload XSS on firefox, we changed the angular action from ng-focus to ng-blur. Now, the input element will render autofocused, and whenever a user clicks out of it, it will trigger the ng-blur action and the XSS will execute
- Now, all we have to do is find a way to automatically steal the focus from the autofocused input element to trigger the XSS
- To do this, we included a meta tag in our payload which will redirect the user to mail someone. But why?
- On a normal redirect, the entire page will just be redirected and the XSS won't have time to execute. However, when redirecting a user to mail, they will stay on the same page, but a new popup will appear asking them which mail client they want to use
- This popup effectively steals the focus from the input element, causing a blur, which triggers angular's ng-blur, and thus executes the XSS

#### To bypass CSP (JSONP):
- After bypassing the CSP with focus stealing, we became aware of a much simpler solution.
- We were aware of the JSONP attack vector beforehand, however couldn't find a good one in any of the whitelisted domains despite the amount of googling and waybackurls we did
- Interestingly enough, this simple JSONP endpoint seemed to work too:
- Which leads us to the following payload
